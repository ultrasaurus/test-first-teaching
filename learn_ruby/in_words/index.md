# Extending a built-in class

To make this test pass you'll need to extend a built-in class. You'll see that we're creating a new spec for 'Fixnum' -- this isn't a new class you'll be building, but instead it is a built-in class you will extend.

Remember that in Ruby, everything is an object, even a number.  Try this in irb:

    >> 4.class
    => Fixnum
    >> 4.methods
    \["inspect", "%", "<<", ...

The number 4 is of class `FixNum` and it has methods on it.  Your challenge is to add an `in_words` method to `FixNum`.
