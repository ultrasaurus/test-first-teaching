# # Pig Latin
#
# Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing. It obeys a few simple rules (below) but when it's spoken quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand.
#
# Rule 1: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
#
# Rule 2: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.
#
# (There are a few more rules for edge cases, and there are regional variants too, but that should be enough to understand the tests.)
#
# See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin> for more details.

  # * write a test asserting that capitalized words are still capitalized (but with a different initial capital letter, of course)
  # * retain the punctuation from the original phrase
