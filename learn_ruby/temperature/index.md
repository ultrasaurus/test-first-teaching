# Hints

Remember that one degree fahrenheit is 5/9 of one degree celsius, and that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees celsius but 32 degrees fahrenheit.

In integer math, there **are no fractions**. So if you are using integer literals, you will be using integer math, which means, for example...

   1 / 2 => 0

In floating point math, there **are** fractions. So...

   1.0 / 2.0 => 0.5
