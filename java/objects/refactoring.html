    <h1>Bonus: Refactoring Lesson</h1>

    <p>
      While we were creating the Stock and Portfolio objects
      test-first, we needed a totalValue method.  For simplicity's
      sake, we put it inside the Stock class.  But now that we have a
      Portfolio object, we see that <tt>Stock.totalValue</tt> is not
      useful any more.  Furthermore, the code inside
      <tt>Stock.totalValue</tt> is nearly identical to the code inside
      <tt>Portfolio.getTotalValue</tt>.  There is a simple three-stage
      refactoring that will remove this redundancy and leave us with
      cleaner code that is easier to understand, maintain, and
      improve.

    <h2>Step 1: Move method</h2>
    <p>
      Move the method totalValue from Stock.java to Portfolio.java.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will make Portfolio.java look something like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
...
    public double getTotalValue()
    {
        double total = 0;
        for (int i=0; i&lt;c; ++i)
        {
            total += assets[i].getValue();
        }
        return total;
    }

    public static double totalValue(Asset[] assets)
    {
        double total = 0;
        for (int i=0; i&lt;c; ++i)
        {
            total += assets[i].getValue();
        }
        return total;
    }
...
    </pre>
    <p>
      If you are not using a Refactoring Tool (like IDEA or Eclipse)
      then you will have to manually go through your source code, find
      all references to <tt>Stock.totalValue()</tt>, and change them
      to call <tt>Portfolio.totalValue</tt> instead.  (Yes, this means
      changing it in tests as well.  (A Refactoring Tool will take
      care of this sort of tedious change for you.)  Once you've made
      this change, recompile and run all tests.  To be sure you caught
      them all, you may want to delete all *.class files -- this will
      force javac to recompile every single source file.
    </p>
    <h2>Step 2: Merge Methods</h2>
    <p>
      Notice that the contents of the two methods are nearly
      identical.  We can define one in terms of the other, unifying
      them as follows:
    </p>
    <pre>
    public static double totalValue(Asset[] assets)
    {
        return new Portfolio(assets).getTotalValue();
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
      While this may seem slightly less efficient (we need to create a
      new Portfolio object each time), this will only become visible
      if this method happens to be called inside a critical loop.  
    </p>
    <p>
      After you make the change, compile and re-run all the tests to
      make sure the two methods really were equivalent.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Inline method (optional)</h2>
    <p>
      The static totalValue method is now almost useless.  If you
      like, you can make it go away entirely by replacing every call
      to
    </p>
<pre>Portfolio.totalValue(x)</pre>
    <p>
      with
    </p>
<pre>new Portfolio(x).getTotalValue()</pre>
    <p>
      elsewhere in your code.  Once you have done that for all
      callers, you may delete the static totalValue method altogether.
      Then do a clean recompile (to make sure you caught all the
      references).
    </p>
